        <ul class="About-list">
            <p>My name is Cade Muntz and I was born and raised in Albany, Oregon. Growing up I was always infatuated with video games, specifically a little game called Runescape. Runescape led me to being extremely interested in everything there was to do involving computers, and the story of the two brothers who made the game always stuck with me as they were a couple of young adults who made their dream of creating a little MMO game come true in their mothers living room. 
                This always inspired me to learn more about computers and systems in general, even leading to me building my own personal gaming systems and learning simple "hello world" programs using python. Because of this passion for computers and coding, I decided I wanted to go into a computer science role. However, while taking my computer science classes, I also had to take a statistics class, which reminded me of how much I enjoyed my statstics class in highschool. This led to me changing my major to an analytics role, as I became truly infatuated with Data and its uses.
                I simply love data, and creating statistical models to be able to predict the future. I think it is extremely exciting and I am very passionate about it and manage to do it in my free time as well by just finding random datasets and creating little models to see what I can find. I believe this is because overall I am a very curious person, and am always interested in what stories data can tell.
                While purusing my analytics major, I had to take a business information systems overview course, which reminded me of my younger days when I was interested in building computers. This led to me adding onto my major as I wanted to learn more about the backend of systems as well, which got me into data management courses which I also fell in love with.

                In the next coming years I would love to get situated into some sort of data role, whether that be analytical or even data mangement / data engineering. I think both sides of data are super interesting and make me want to learn even more about the different processes and procedures that can be done using data. Data is all about possibilities.
                Although, my true passions definitely lie in Marketing Analytics, and ideally in 5 years I can land myself into a marketing analytics role, as I feel thats where my true talents and passions lie. In my free time I enjoy writing code, going on hikes, and playing mind challenging games such as card games, and chess.

                This was just a short blurb into my life and I hope to be able to share more about myself in interviews and getting to know a great team. Thank you for reading!
